        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil </li>
            <li>2 medium onions </li>
            <li>2 celery stalks </li>
            <li>2 carrots </li>
            <li>6 oz. ground beef</li>
            <li>3 oz. thinly sliced pancetta, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry red wine</li>
            <li>3 cups (about) beef stock or chicken stock, divided</li>
            <li>3 tbsp. tomato paste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add onions, celery, and carrots. Sauté until soft, 8-10 minutes. Add beef, veal, and pancetta; sauté, breaking up with the back of a spoon, until browned, about 15 minutes. Add wine; boil 1 minute, stirring often and scraping up browned bits. Add 2 1/2 cups stock and tomato paste; stir to blend. Reduce heat to very low and gently simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors meld, 1 1/2 hours. Season with salt and pepper.

                Bring milk to a simmer in a small saucepan; gradually add to sauce. Cover sauce with lid slightly ajar and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally, until milk is absorbed, about 45 minutes, adding more stock by 1/4-cupfuls to thin if needed.</li>

                <strong>DO AHEAD:</strong> Ragù can be made 2 days ahead. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Rewarm before continuing.

                Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season with salt; add pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until 1 minute before al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water. Transfer ragù to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pasta and toss to coat. Stir in some of the reserved pasta water by tablespoonfuls if sauce seems dry. Divide pasta among warm plates. Serve with Parmesan.
